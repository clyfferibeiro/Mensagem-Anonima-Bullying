Instead, generate an app-specific password:

🚶‍♂️ Head over to your Google Account.

🖱️ On the left navigation panel, click on `Security`.

🔐 Under `Signing in to Google`, select `App Passwords`. You might need to sign in again.

📱 At the bottom, choose the app and device you want the app password for, then select `Generate`.

🎉 Use this app password in the Streamlit app.

## Troubleshooting 🚑

If you encounter the error `Failed to send email: ...`, double-check your credentials and ensure you've followed the `Important Notes` section above.
